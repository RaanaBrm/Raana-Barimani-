        <p>
            Hi there! I’m a Computer Engineer with a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering and a friendly, people-centered approach to IT. Over the past 7 years, I’ve combined technical expertise with strong collaboration skills in software development, IT support, and system management. I had the privilege of working at two shipbuilding companies, where I focused on streamlining IT processes and ensuring smooth operations for technical teams.

            Currently, I’m enhancing my skills in Frontend Development at Hyper Island, exploring how modern web technologies can create seamless user experiences. My technical toolkit includes C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and MySQL, but what truly sets me apart is my ability to connect with teams and users, simplifying complex systems to make them accessible and efficient.
            
            I’m passionate about bridging the gap between technology and people, continuously learning to bring both innovation and a human touch to every project I’m part of. Let’s make technology work better for everyone!
        </p>
